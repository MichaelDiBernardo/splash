Splash
=========

Splash is a simple 3D videogame that I wrote in C++ and OpenGL in 2007. It
started out as a graphics assignment for a mixed grad/undergrad class I took at
the University of British Columbia. While I was there, I noticed that several
of the undergrads were bombing their assignments because they basically had no
idea how to structure a mid-size C++ project -- this was typically the first
time a UBC undergrad would have been exposed to C++ at all.

I thus expanded Splash to be a bit more complicated, restructured things, and
heavily documented everything so that it could be used as sort of a "sample
project" for incoming students. It was used in that capacity for several years
before I accidentally and unwittingly obliterated it from my old website. 

I have decided to host it here for posterity, and to serve as an occasional
reminder to myself of how convoluted (and fun!) it can be to do anything in
C++.

As of the time of this writing (2013), I was able to compile and run Splash
using gcc 4.2.1 and OpenGL version string: 1.4. Gameplay is simple: Choose a
level (they start locked, I believe), and then try to "eat" all the dots before
getting caught by a red dino. 

The crystals are powerups: it should be pretty easy to figure out what they do :)
